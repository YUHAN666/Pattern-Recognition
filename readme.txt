Instrution to run the .m files
1.Please copy these files to your Matlab path
NOTE: 
1.The file BNB refers to the Beta-binomial Naive Bayes Classifier
2.The file GNB refers to the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
3.The file LR refers to the Logistic Regression Classifier
4.The file KNN refers to the K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
2.Run the .m files with your Matlab 
NOTE: 
1.The file BNB will output a figure plot the error rate for the training set and the testing set versus the parameter alpha, 
the error rate for alpha=1,10,100 are saved in the TestR and TrainR
2.The file GNB will output the errorRateTest and the errorRateTrain into the command window
3.The file LR will out put a figure plot the error rate for the training set and the testing set versus the parameter lambda,
the error rate for lambda=1,10,100 are saved in the TestR and TrainR
3.The file KNN will run for a long time, roughly 10 minutes. 
The file KNN will out put a figure plot the error rate for the training set and the testing set versus the parameter K,
the error rate for K=1,10,100 are saved in the TestR and TrainR
